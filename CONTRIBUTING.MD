# Contributing to NTUCourses

We would love for you to contribute to NTUCourses and help make it even better than it is today! As a contributer, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

- [Code of Conduct](#)
- [Question or Problem?](#)
- [Issues and Bugs](#)
- [Feature Requests](#)
- [Submission Guidelines](#)
- [Coding Rules](#)
- [Commit Message Guidelines](#)

## Code of Conduct

Help us keep NTUCourses open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](#).

## Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [submitting an issue](#) to our [GitHub Repository](#). Even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#) with a fix.

## Missing a Feature?

You can _request_ a new feature by [submitting an issue](#) to our GitHub Repository. If you would like to _implement_ a new feature, please consider the size of the change in order to determine the right steps to proceed:
- For a __Major Feature__, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This process allows us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
- __Small Features__ can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](#).

## Submission Guidelines

### Submitting as Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs, we require that you provide a minimal reproduction. Having a minimal reproducible scenario gives us a wealth of important information without going back and forth to you with additional questions.

A minimal reproduction allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.

We require a minimal reproduction to save maintainers' time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs. Often, developers find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal reproduction. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essential bits of code from a larger codebase but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.

Unfortunately, we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you, we are going to close an issue that doesn't have enough info to be reproduced.

You can file new issues by selecting from our [new issue templates](#) and filling out the issue template.
